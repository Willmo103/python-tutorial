# SLIDE: 4Python Environment Setup
Proper environment setup is crucial for successful Python development
 This section covers installation, virtual environments, and package management



    ~~~~~~~~    

# SLIDE: 5INSTALLING PYTHON
The official Python website provides the latest stable version for download
The installer includes the Python interpreter, pip (package manager), and IDLE (a basic IDE)



    ~~~~~~~~    

# SLIDE: 6INTRODUCTION TO VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENTS
Virtual environments prevent package conflicts between different projects
Each virtual environment has its own Python interpreter and package installation location
Activating a virtual environment changes the Python interpreter and package location for the current terminal session


    ~~~~~~~~    

# SLIDE: 7INSTALLING AND MANAGING PACKAGES WITH PIP
pip is the default package manager for Python
It allows you to install, update, and remove packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI)
You can also use pip to manage your project's dependencies by saving them to a requirements
txt file
